## **Sample Click-Wrap Acceptance Notice**

To ensure that users agree to the Terms before accessing your content, implement a click-wrap agreement. Here’s an example of how you might structure it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Terms of Service Agreement</title>
  <style>
    /* Basic styling for modal */
    .modal {
      display: block; /* Show the modal */
      position: fixed;
      z-index: 1000;
      left: 0;
      top: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      overflow: auto;
      background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
    }
    .modal-content {
      background-color: #fefefe;
      margin: 10% auto;
      padding: 20px;
      border: 1px solid #888;
      width: 80%;
      max-height: 80%;
      overflow-y: scroll;
    }
    .agree-button {
      background-color: #4CAF50;
      color: white;
      padding: 10px 20px;
      margin-top: 20px;
      border: none;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
  </style>
  <script>
    function agreeTerms() {
      // Set a cookie or localStorage item to remember agreement
      document.cookie = "tos_agreed=true; path=/; max-age=" + (60*60*24*30); // 30 days
      document.getElementById('tos-modal').style.display = 'none';
    }

    window.onload = function() {
      // Check if user has already agreed
      if (document.cookie.split(';').some((item) => item.trim().startsWith('tos_agreed='))) {
        document.getElementById('tos-modal').style.display = 'none';
      } else {
        document.getElementById('tos-modal').style.display = 'block';
      }
    };
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="tos-modal" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>[Insert your comprehensive Terms of Service here]</p>
      <button class="agree-button" onclick="agreeTerms()">I Agree</button>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Your website content goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Modal Display:** A modal window appears when the user visits the site, blocking access to the content until they agree.
2. **Agreement Mechanism:** The user must click the “I Agree” button to set a cookie indicating their agreement.
3. **Persistent Agreement:** The cookie ensures the user doesn't have to agree every time they visit, lasting for 30 days.
4. **Access Control:** If the cookie is not set, the modal remains visible, preventing access to the Website’s content.

**Note:** Customize the modal styling and behavior to fit your website’s design and user experience preferences. Additionally, ensure that the ToS content is easily readable within the modal.
