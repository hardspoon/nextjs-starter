Open Letter to Auto Finance Lenders: Collaborating for a Fair and Competitive Repossession Industry

Dear Valued Partners in Auto Finance,

I am reaching out to you today as a fellow stakeholder deeply invested in the health and integrity of our industry. Over the years, we’ve collectively navigated the challenges of auto financing and asset recovery, striving to serve our customers effectively while maintaining robust business operations. However, recent developments threaten the balance and competitiveness that have long underpinned our mutual success.

The Growing Concern of Market Control

As you are aware, the advent of License Plate Recognition (LPR) technology has revolutionized the repossession landscape. Companies like Digital Recognition Network (DRN) have become pivotal players, providing critical data that enhances our efficiency and recovery rates. Yet, with this technological advancement comes a concentration of control that raises significant concerns.

Many lenders, perhaps including your organization, have felt the impact of DRN’s dominant position. Restrictions on data sharing, limitations on platform participation, and instances of data prioritization have not only affected operational efficiency but also raised questions about fair competition and compliance with antitrust laws.

Our Shared Challenges

	•	Operational Constraints: Restrictions imposed by DRN may have limited your ability to assign repossession orders freely, impacting recovery rates and increasing operational costs.
	•	Economic Impact: The monopolistic control over LPR data can lead to inflated subscription costs and reduce the bargaining power of lenders.
	•	Compliance Risks: There may be potential legal implications associated with participating in or acquiescing to anticompetitive practices.

Why This Matters to You

Your organization relies on a competitive, transparent, and fair repossession industry to maximize asset recovery and minimize losses. The current dynamics threaten these principles, potentially affecting your bottom line and stakeholder trust.

A Call for Collective Action

I propose that we, as key industry players, come together to address these challenges proactively. By sharing our experiences and data—confidentially and anonymously—we can:

	•	Assess the Impact: Quantify the economic and operational effects of the current market dynamics.
	•	Explore Legal Avenues: Determine if there are grounds for antitrust action or regulatory intervention.
	•	Drive Industry Change: Advocate for fair practices that benefit all stakeholders, including lenders, agents, and forwarders.

Your Voice Matters

I understand that raising concerns can be daunting, especially when dealing with influential industry players. However, there is strength in numbers and safety in collective action. Your insights and experiences are invaluable in driving meaningful change.

Next Steps

	•	Share Your Experience: Contribute to our confidential survey designed to gather data on the impact of DRN’s practices.
	•	Join the Dialogue: Participate in a secure forum where we can discuss these issues openly and strategize collectively.
	•	Support the Initiative: Your backing can help us engage legal and economic experts to explore potential remedies.

Conclusion

We have a unique opportunity to safeguard the future of our industry by standing together against practices that undermine competition and fairness. Your participation is crucial in this endeavor.

Together, we can foster a repossession industry that is fair, competitive, and beneficial for all.

Open Letter to Forwarding Companies: Uniting for Fair Practices in the Repossession Industry

Dear Esteemed Colleagues in Forwarding,

I write to you not just as a fellow professional in the repossession forwarding industry but as someone deeply concerned about the challenges we collectively face. Our role as intermediaries between lenders and repossession agents is critical, yet recent industry shifts threaten our ability to operate effectively and fairly.

The Challenge We Face

The increasing control exerted by DRN over LPR data and assignment platforms has placed significant constraints on our operations:

	•	Restricted Access: Limitations on “staging” assignments on the LPR platform hinder our ability to efficiently manage repossession orders.
	•	Operational Hurdles: While we can assign orders directly through platforms like RDN, DRN’s restrictions complicate these processes, impacting our efficiency.
	•	Economic Pressures: The monopolistic grip on essential data increases our costs and reduces our competitiveness.
	•	Fear of Retribution: Openly addressing these issues is risky, with potential repercussions from dominant industry players.

Our Shared Stake in the Industry

We have built our businesses on principles of fairness, efficiency, and partnership. The current environment undermines these values, affecting not only our companies but the entire repossession ecosystem.

Why Action Is Needed Now

	•	Protecting Our Businesses: Without intervention, the constraints imposed may escalate, further diminishing our operational capabilities and profitability.
	•	Ensuring Fair Competition: A single entity controlling critical data and platforms distorts the market, disadvantaging forwarders and, ultimately, lenders and agents.
	•	Legal and Ethical Considerations: There may be antitrust implications to these practices that need to be explored.

An Invitation to Collaborate

I propose that we unite to address these challenges. By sharing our experiences and data anonymously, we can:

	•	Quantify the Impact: Understand the full extent of the economic and operational effects on forwarding companies.
	•	Explore Legal Remedies: Assess whether antitrust laws have been violated and consider appropriate actions.
	•	Develop Collective Strategies: Work together to find solutions, whether through alternative platforms, lobbying for regulatory changes, or other means.

Addressing Concerns

I recognize the apprehension surrounding this issue. The fear of retribution is real, but by collaborating confidentially, we can protect ourselves while working towards a common goal.

How You Can Participate

	•	Contribute Anonymously: Share your experiences through a secure, confidential survey.
	•	Join the Conversation: Participate in discussions with other forwarders to share insights and strategies.
	•	Support the Cause: Your involvement can help us engage with legal experts and advocate for industry-wide changes.

Moving Forward Together

Our strength lies in unity. By coming together, we can challenge unfair practices and help restore balance and fairness to our industry.

Please consider joining this crucial initiative. Visit [Secure Platform/Website] for more information and to participate.

Let’s stand together to ensure a fair and competitive future for all forwarders.

Warm regards,

[Your Name/Organization]

Open Letter to Competing LPR Data Vendors: Advocating for Fair Competition and Innovation

Dear Fellow Innovators in LPR Technology,

As pioneers and developers in the field of License Plate Recognition (LPR) technology, we have all contributed to advancing the repossession industry through innovation and dedication. However, recent market developments pose significant challenges to our collective ability to compete, innovate, and thrive.

The Current Landscape

The dominant position of DRN in the LPR data market has led to:

	•	Market Exclusion: Many of us have faced barriers to entry or expansion due to exclusive agreements and platform restrictions.

	•	Unfair Competitive Practices: Instances of prioritization and preferential treatment distort the market dynamics, disadvantaging other vendors.

Why This Matters to All of Us

	•	Innovation Suppression: A monopolistic environment stifles innovation, limiting the advancement of technology that benefits the entire industry.
	•	Economic Impact: Reduced market access translates to lost revenues, hindered growth, and diminished returns on our investments in research and development.
	•	Market Health: A competitive market ensures better services and prices for all stakeholders, including lenders, agents, and forwarders.

Our Shared Vision

We all entered this industry with a vision to provide cutting-edge solutions that enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Upholding fair competition is essential to realizing this vision.

	•	Promote Fair Competition: Advocate for industry standards and regulations that prevent monopolistic control and encourage innovation.
	•	Foster Collaboration: Share insights, resources, and strategies to strengthen our market positions.

Addressing Potential Concerns

I understand that taking a stand can be daunting. Concerns about retaliation or further exclusion are valid. However, by uniting and taking collective action, we can mitigate these risks and amplify our impact.

Next Steps

	•	Confidential Data Sharing: Participate in a secure and anonymous survey to quantify the economic and operational effects on our businesses.
	•	Join the Discussion: Engage in a private forum with other LPR vendors to share experiences and develop strategies.
